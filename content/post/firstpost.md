Although published in 1919, Yeats' poem oozes a brooding contemporary tone that makes it one of my favorite poems. I love the grimly resigned criticism of modernity and frightening imagery that seems to comment directly upon the century we live in now.

"The best lack all conviction, while the worst
are full of passionate intensity"
